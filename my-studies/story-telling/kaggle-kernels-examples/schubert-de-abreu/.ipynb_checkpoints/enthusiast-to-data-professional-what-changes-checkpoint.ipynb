    "I'm sure many of you have read articles about all the buzz words in our community - \"Machine Learning\", \"Data Scientist\", \"AI\" and so on. Some have even branded data science as the \"**sexiest job of the 21st century**\"! While these articles go on about the high earnings and the supposed demand for them, very rarely do they go in to **what it takes to work with data**. They even tend to throw around a lot of terms like \"data analyst\", \"business analyst\", \"machine learning engineer\" without ever explaining what each one specifically deals with, while often **using them interchangably**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I aim to provide to all the enthusiasts in our community a better understanding of the field, the different jobs that work with data and what do they actually do in their day-to-day work. It also gives students a better insight into what technologies are used and hopefully will empower them with the information to help them break into some of these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also keep this notebook rather short, while I do enjoy designing graphs I am strong believer of quality over quantity so I will avoid bombarding you'll with any more information than is necessary, just for the sake of displaying data."

    "\n",
    "We will talk about a lot of tools and processes throughout the course of this notebook. This section will go over the basic steps and terminology in the data life cycle and will help enthusiasts understand how each of the discussed tools fit into the actual workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is rarely linear and often occurs over multiple iterations. While the order of stages or terminology might be different, a basic overview of the stages in handling and working with data are as follows:\n",
    "1. Problem Identification\n",
    "2. Business Understanding\n",
    "3. Data Acquisition\n",
    "4. Data Cleaning\n",
    "5. Data Visualisation\n",
    "6. Feature Engineering\n",
    "7. Model Training\n",
    "8. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Problem Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Often when starting out, the objective of a data science project might be rather ambiguous or we might lack an understanding of what exactly is the problem and how it affects all the parties involved. We remedy this by asking questions - *a lot of them* . We try get a better understanding of the domain and the root cause of the problem by speaking to the stakeholders and industry experts. Literature reviews and surveys will also help us decide what data we might want to collect and use.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**2. Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   At this stage we try to define the business objective behind our data science problem. For example, we might be analysing prospective market segments with the **business objective of increasing the company's market share and the resulting profits**. Identifying such a business objective helps us define our success criteria for the project. We also define the metrics that will help us track our progress towards our objective:\n",
    "   - **KPI(Key Performance Indicator)**: Measure your performance against key business objectives. Businesses use this to measure their performance against objectives and the overall health of their business.\n",
    "   - **SLA(Service Level Agreement)**: These describe the level of service that will be provided to the client. It defines the metrics by which the performance will measured and also the penalties incurred if these standards aren't met. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Poorly designed metrics will affect how the product is priced, customer experience and the overall company reputation, so its important to get this right.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**3. Data Acquisition**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In most data science industry projects, you will be using data that already exists and is being collected. Occasionally, you’ll be leading efforts to collect new data, but that can be a lot of engineering work and it can take a while to bear fruit. This is an iterative process often using an ETL/ELT pipeline consisting of the main stages:\n",
    "   - **Extract:** Extraction refers to pulling the source data from the original database or data source. With ETL, the data goes into a temporary staging area. With ELT, it goes immediately into a data lake storage system.\n",
    "   - **Transform:** Transformation refers to the process of changing the structure of the information, so it integrates with the target data system and the rest of the data in that system.\n",
    "   - **Load:** Loading refers to the process of depositing the information into a data storage system.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**4. Data Cleaning** \n",
    "\n",
    "   Just because the data is loaded into storage doesn't mean that its ready to be used in your analysis. Collected data may be full of issues like corrupted data, incorrectly formatted or invalid entries, duplicate data, etc. Remedying this is a time consuming process, because each field having missing or incorrect data begs another question as to why something went wrong that caused this to happen and also how do we fix this incorrect data. Such a task takes a great deal of manual effort and expertise to perform which soaks up a large chunk of data professionals' time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**5. Data Visualisation** \n",
    "   \n",
    "   We now explore the data, looking for patterns and insights that might be worth investigating through the use of graphs and charts. Data visualisation is important not only in data exploration, but also when understanding our tracked metrics and communicating our results to answer our clients' most important questions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**6. Feature Engineering** \n",
    "   \n",
    "   We utilise domain knowledge to craft features that will improve the performance of our machine learning model. This often involves applying data transforms like log transformation, binning, category encoding, etc. In this step we may also attempt to mitigate any bias in the data, remove outliers, etc.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**7. Model Training** \n",
    "\n",
    "   We start out by developing a baseline model that we will use as a reference against which we will test later models. This is an iterative process as one experiments with different algorithms, network architectures as well as the choice for loss metrics and hyperparameters used.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**8. Model Deployment** \n",
    "   Now we need to deploy our model so that it may be used by either the business or the client. Before you deploy a model, there are a couple of criteria that your machine learning model needs to achieve before it’s ready for deployment:\n",
    " - **Portability**: this refers to the ability of your software to be transferred from one machine or system to another. A portable model is one with a relatively low response time and one that can be rewritten with minimal effort.\n",
    " - **Scalability**: this refers to how large your model can scale. A scalable model is one that doesn’t need to be redesigned to maintain its performance. \n",

    "- In later age, groups the proportion Masters still remains around the 40-60% mark, with Doctoral degrees as a close second, while the numbers for bachelors slowly decreases.\n",

A notable exception being Research Scientists where more than half the respondents have doctoral degrees and when you include Masters and Professional degree holders this number comprises of 93% of the total professionals in their field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional points of interest:\n",
    "- In most fields **Masters degree seems to be the way to go** with 30-55% of respondents having one.\n",
    "- A **bachelors degree** seems to be a close second with numbers around the 20-30% mark.\n",
    "- **Professional degrees** seem to be a less common choice with around 4-5% having one. Hovewer they do help to get jobs because professional degree holders have the **second lowest fraction of unemployed individuals**, after Doctoral degree holders."

    "In case you are unclear on what exactly \"production\" means I'll give you a little background here - Traditionally, when a data scientist would create an ML model they would often do so in a sandbox or development environment. This is **great for experimenting and reiterating quickly**, however in order for the consumers to use it, the model must be deployed so that it **scales well with increased usage volumes and is always available** for use by others. This deployment however, requires a skill-set different than what most data scientists possess and often this **burden falls on the Software Engineers**. \n",

    "* **Big data management:** When people talk about big data, one of the first things that come to a lot of peoples' mind is deep learning and how it leverages massive volumes of data to generate powerful models. Rarely does one think of big data management which actually encompasses the entire range of **policies, procedures and technologies that are utilised in the organization and administration of large repositories of data**. Often students will glaze over this part of data management because its one of the more mundane parts of the job.\n",
    "* **Deep Learning and Machine Learning:** Based on the specifics of the role, companies also place a lot of importance on the recruit having a good foundation in the **working of machine learning and deep learning algorithms** as well as a hands-on experience of **when to apply** these to specfic problems.\n",
    "* **Advanced Mathematics:** While admittedly there are slight variations on the exact content of \"advanced mathematics\", it is a safe bet that if one wants to work with data they should be **well-versed with the basics of algebra, statistics, calculus and trigonometry**, and must be comfortable to delve deeper into these topics should their work require it"

    "I initially expected that a lack of job openings would be a major factor, but turns out that this was hardly the case. Most students claimed that their reason for not securing their ideal job was that they **lacked the experience** for it. Often this will be due to companies asking for \"*x years of experience in...*\" which will turn away most students early in their careers, otherwise it might be experience working in a particular field or with specific tools.<br>  While there may be no direct workaround for this, **seeking internships** in a related area of work would go a long way as initial work experience. Data science **side-projects** are also a great way to showcase your ability, so long as the content is novel and well-thought out."

    "Let's now look at the NLP specific behaviours:\n",
    "* Understanding **Word Embeddings** is part of building a strong foundation in NLP. Word embeddings is a means of representing words in such a manner that words similar in meaning have similar representations.\n",
    "* **Transformer networks** function similar to Recurrent Neural Networks in the sense that they are useful to handle sequential. A key difference that makes this useful in NLP is the fact that they don't require data to be processed in order(so the beginning of the sentence needn't always be processed before the end). This makes parellisation easier, resulting in reduced training times.\n",
    "* **Encoder decoder models are used in sequence to sequence operations** like text summarising, question answering. They utilise one encoding network to encode the input sequence and another decoding network to convert this into the desired target.\n",
    "* **Contextualised word embeddings** provide additional information in the embedding regarding the context in which it was used. eg. \"ground\" has different meanings in \"ground coffee\" and \"training grounds\" which is determined based on context.\n",

I would definitely recommend it as a resource for getting your D3 visualisations up and running in Kaggle Notebooks.\n",
    "* [The D3 Graph Gallery](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/): D3 is a pain if you're going to create every graph from scratch. I tend to start every graph by taking the bare bones code from here, plugging in my own data and then modifying/adding interactivity as needed.\n",
